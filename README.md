<h1><b> ˗ˏˋ Pomodoro timer ˎˊ˗ </b></h1>

This is a simple [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) that you can use if you want to improve your productivity.

<h2><b> How does this work? </b></h2>
<p> When you start the pomodoro it will be shown in your terminal the message "pomodoro started", meaning that your pomodoro just started.
<p> Within 25 minutes a new terminal window will be open to show the message "rest", so it's time for a break. It lasts 5 minutes.
<p> when the rest ends, another terminal window will be open showing the message "Time to work", and it starts another session of 25 minutes of work.
<p> This will be repeated 4 times, but the last rest break will lasts 30 minutes.
<p> After the last break, and longest one, you will be asked if you want to start a new pomodoro session.

<h2><b> How to use </b></h2>
<p> To run the code you just go to the directory where the code is and write this in your terminal:

	$ python pomodoro.py
	
<p> Do not put the files in different directories, in order to ensure pomodoro.py works fine.
<p><b> You need a debian derivate distro or MacOSX to run pomodoro </b>
